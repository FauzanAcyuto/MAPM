# HAPM
Highly Available Product Management Tool

Hi!

I made this project because work needed a highly customized project management tool for our SLA Calculations. And since doing it in spreadsheets is BORING, I decided to self-host some applications to make it a bit more interesting.

## Concept
There are some requirements for this project:
1. The tools must be open-sourced and self-hosted (I want full ownership of all data)
2. All the data and configs must in a database that I own
3. As much of the infrastructure should be in AWS, but if it gets expensive, use my personal server at home
4. The services should be highly available
